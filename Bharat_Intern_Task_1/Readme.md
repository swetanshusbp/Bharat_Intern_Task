## Description

# Imports and Data Loading:

Required libraries, such as pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib, are imported.
A dataset named "melbourne_housing.csv" is read into a DataFrame df.
Basic Data Exploration:

The top rows of the dataset are printed using the head() method.
# Data Preprocessing:

The target variable 'Price' is separated from the features, resulting in X (features) and y (target).
The dataset is split into training (X_train and y_train) and testing (X_test and y_test) sets.
Only numeric features are selected from X_train and X_test.
Any rows containing NaN values in X_train and corresponding rows in y_train are dropped. Similarly, any rows with NaN values in X_test and corresponding rows in y_test are dropped.
Model Building and Prediction:

A linear regression model is instantiated and trained on X_train and y_train.
Predictions are made on the X_test dataset.
Model Evaluation:

The mean squared error between the actual and predicted values is computed and printed.
# Data Visualization:

A heatmap is created to show the correlation between numeric features in X_test.

Histograms are plotted for each numeric feature in X_test.

Boxplots are generated for each numeric feature in X_test to visualize outliers and the spread of data.

Scatter plots are generated to visualize the relationship between each feature in X_test and the target variable y_test.

Scatter plots in 3D space are created for actual and predicted values, using the first two numeric features of X_test for the x and y axes, and the target values/predictions for the z-axis.

Another 3D scatter plot is shown, juxtaposing actual and predicted values in the same plot space.

A 3D line plot is created to visualize the predicted values.

# This code aims to provide an end-to-end demonstration of a linear regression modeling task – from loading the data, preprocessing, modeling, to visualizing results.
